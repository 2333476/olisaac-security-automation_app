Short Reflection

This project successfully combined hardware components, software, and cloud services into a functional IoT home security system.
Using Adafruit IO for live data visualization and device control worked very well.
Storing data locally with SQLite helped us organize sensor readings and security events efficiently.
The project took a long time to complete because of the number of features and integrations involved.
We encountered many bugs during development, especially when connecting sensors, databases, and the Flask application together.
Debugging and testing each component required patience and careful problem-solving.
One difficulty in the interface design was that we were missing a proper logo, which limited how polished the final UI looked.
If we were to improve the project, we would focus on better UI design and cleaner code organization from the start.
